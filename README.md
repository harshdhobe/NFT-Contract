Here's a sample README file for your NFT contract project built using Solidity, Filebase, and Alchemy. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and how to interact with the contract.

NFT Contract with Solidity, Filebase, and Alchemy
This repository contains a decentralized NFT contract built using Solidity, which is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows users to mint unique NFTs (ERC721 tokens) and associate them with metadata stored on Filebase, a decentralized file storage service. The contract also integrates with Alchemy to enable easy interaction with the blockchain through a Web3 interface.
